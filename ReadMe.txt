In this project, we have investigated how deep learning methods and classic recommender models perform in datasets of various sizes and with a "time stamps" variable. More specifically, we have
dived into four deep neural network models, NeuMF, Wide and Deep, DeepFM, and improved DIN to analyze their performances in different scenarios.

We used Douba Movie, Amazon Electronics and ModCloth Datasets for this project. 

This was our final project for Deep Learning course @ HEC MTL. Winter 2021.
